1
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:37,895
I see life in angles

2
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:40,983
in lines of perspective – the slow turn of a head

3
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,678
the blink of an eye

4
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,164
subtle glimpses of magic

5
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:46,626
other folk might pass by

6
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:51,270
Cameras help me translate, interpret and understand what I see

7
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,335
It’s a simple act that keeps me grinnin

8
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:57,910
I never set out to become anything in particular

9
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,116
only to live creatively

10
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:03,460
and push the scope of my experience for adventure

11
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,178
and for passion

12
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:08,127
They still all mean something to me

13
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,426
same as most anyone with dreams

14
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,537
My heart bleeds celtic blood

15
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:16,463
and I magnetize the familiar frontiers

16
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:22,082
The raw brutal cold coastlands for the right waveriders to challenge

17
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:25,380
this is where my heart beats hardest

18
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,767
I try to pay tribute to that magic through photographs

19
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:35,364
Weathering the endless staunch for rare glimpses of magic each winter

20
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,813
is both a blessing

21
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:39,033
and a curse I relish

22
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:44,420
I wanna see waveriding documented the way I see it in my head

23
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,719
and the way I feel it in the sea

24
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:52,268
This is a strange set of skills to begin to acquire

25
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,401
and is only achievable through time spent riding waves

26
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:00,697
All sorts of waves on all sorts of crafts

27
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:03,321
This is more time learning out on the water

28
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,292
floating in the sea amongst lumps and swells

29
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:09,732
you always learn something

30
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,468
It’s been a lifelong wise old classroom teacher of sorts

31
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,151
and hopefully

32
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,951
it always will be

33
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:27,121
Buried beneath headlands

34
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:28,584
shaping the coast

35
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:32,741
mind-blowing images of empty waves burn away at me

36
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:37,640
Solid ocean swells powering through deep cold water

37
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:41,193
heavy waves weighs we'll wait

38
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:44,235
they coaxed from comfortable routine

39
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,046
ignite the imagination

40
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,182
conveys some of the viny spark

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,040
whisper possibilities

42
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,173
conjure the situations I thrive amongst and love to document

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,564
We all take knocks in the process

44
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:05,690
broken backs, drownings, near-drownings, hypothermia, dislocations, fractures, frostbite, head wounds, stitches, concussions, broke my arm

45
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,547
and that’s just the last couple of years

46
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,729
still look forward to getting amongst it each winter though

47
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,770
Cold creeping into your core, driving you mad

48
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,931
day after day

49
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:20,272
mumbling to yourself while you hold position and wait for the next set to come

50
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:23,123
The dark side of the lens

51
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,193
An artform that to itself and us

52
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:29,119
silent workhorses of the surfing wake

53
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:32,997
There’s no sugary cliché

54
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:35,507
Most folk don’t even know who we are

55
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,944
what we do or how we do it

56
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,112
let alone what they pay us for it

57
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,727
I never want to take this for granted

58
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:46,255
so I try to keep motivation simple, real, and positive

59
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,158
If I only scrape a living

60
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:52,223
at least it’s a living where I’m scraping

61
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:53,755
If there’s no future in it

62
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:56,704
this is a present worth remembering

63
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:02,091
For fires of happiness and waves of gratitude

64
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:06,456
For everything that brought us to that point on earth at that moment in time

65
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,870
to do something worth remembering with a photograph

66
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,195
or a scar

67
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:17,556
I feel genuinely lucky to hand on heart say I love doing what I did

68
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,576
And I may never be a rich man

69
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,001
for live long enough

70
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,570
then sadly I have a tale or two for the nephews

71
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,751
And I dig the thought of that
